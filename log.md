# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Joining this challenge !

I decided to join this challenge to improve my technical skills and learn new cool stuff.
I'm currently working on my personal Blog/Portfolio and there is a lot of stuff that I'm interested in:
<ul>
<li>Software Craftsmanship, Code Kata</li>
<li>Front end frameworks: React, Vue JS</li>
<li>CodinGame, AI, Graph & Optimization Algorithms</li>
<li>Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible</li>
</ul> 

I will divide this challenge into 10 parts of 10 days, I will put different objectives in each part but the general idea of 
the challenge remains the same, I will update this page every day with my progress!

## Part I : 08/06 - 17/06 :dart:
* Finishing my Blog/Portfolio
* Complete Docker and Kubernetes trainings:
    * https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-docker-2
    * https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-kubernetes 
* Solving one medium puzzle on CodinGame https://www.codingame.com/
* Solving one code Kata http://codekata.com/
* Start reading the pragmatic programmer: Finishing chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/ 
* Solve at least one LeetCode per day!

### Day 1: June 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Started Docker course on LI, install it and started playing a bit with it! Chapter 2 so far! https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-docker-2/the-docker-flow-containers-to-images?u=75507506
* - [x] LeetCode

**Thoughts:** 
It's probably better to do it early in the morning as I was a bit tired after work!
I displayed both hints to solve the leetcode, I should take more time before using them!

### Day 2: June 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* A full leetCode session, solved 4!
* - [x] LeetCode

**Thoughts:** 
4 easy problems, including 2 well optimized solutions.
I should always consider optmization (reducing complexity) after coding a working solution and compare mine to the submitted ones!
Felt bad not working on my portfolio, I'll need to finish it in the first part of this challenge!

### Day 3: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked on my protfolio!
* - [x] LeetCode

**Thoughts:** 
I still some fixes/features before having a first clean version as I imagine it!
Next features: Use Typed.js | Animate the background (Video?) | CSS Display for skills 
I should pick more hard problems on leetCode!

### Day 4: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked on my protfolio!
* Started reading the prgamatic programmer
* - [x] LeetCode

**Thoughts:** 
The pragmatic programmer is an interesting read, looking forward to discovering more!
Spent 25 minutes(Pomodoro technique) on a leetcode problem (Still not solved)

### Day 5: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* LeetCode session
* - [x] LeetCode

**Thoughts:** 
Solved an easy leetCode and stuck for almost 30 min in this one : https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/
In the easy category, however, it was hard for me to understand the problem, took me a lot of time to understand the pattern and find an initial brute force solution! Still not coded yet!

### Day 6: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Pramp session
* - [x] LeetCode (using Pramp)

**Thoughts:** 
Discovered Pramp (https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/)
I enjoyed interviewing and being interviewed by another software engineer. I'll probably do more pramp sessions in the future even if it takes more time (up to 2hours)

### Day 7: June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Pramp session
* - [x] LeetCode (using Pramp)

**Thoughts:** 
Another pramp session (https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/)
What I also like about pramp is receiving feedback from the interviewer at the end of the interview! the history of my performances is available here https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/feedback/yBZp8El636fNYZ6WElvJ

### Day 8: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Pramp session
* - [x] LeetCode (using Pramp)

**Thoughts:** 
Another pramp session (https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/)
I was very unmotivated and a bit tired after work... I wanted to cancel this session but I pushed my self and did it!
Very useful and interesting problem and feedback. I managed to code a working solution with a few hints. However, I should consider space & time complexity. I couldn't figure out the optimized solution!
* Feedback:
   * I should practice coding speed!
   * Optimization and improving time & space complexity using the adapted DS!

### Day 9: June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* 3 Clashs of code and started a CG puzzle!
* - [x] LeetCode -> Not solved

**Thoughts:**
