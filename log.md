# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Joining this challenge !

I decided to join this challenge to improve my technical skills and learn new cool stuff.
I'm currently working on my personal Blog/Portfolio and there is a lot of stuff that I'm interested in:
<ul>
<li>Software Craftsmanship, Code Kata</li>
<li>Front end frameworks: React, Vue JS</li>
<li>CodinGame, AI, Graph & Optimization Algorithms</li>
<li>Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible</li>
</ul> 

I will divide this challenge into 10 parts of 10 days, I will put different objectives in each part but the general idea of 
the challenge remains the same, I will update this page every day with my progress!
