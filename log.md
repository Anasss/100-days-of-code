# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Joining this challenge !

I decided to join this challenge to improve my technical skills and learn new cool stuff.
I'm currently working on my personal Blog/Portfolio and there is a lot of stuff that I'm interested in:
<ul>
<li>Software Craftsmanship, Code Kata</li>
<li>Front end frameworks: React, Vue JS</li>
<li>CodinGame, AI, Graph & Optimization Algorithms</li>
<li>Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible</li>
</ul> 

I will divide this challenge into 10 parts of 10 days, I will put different objectives in each part but the general idea of 
the challenge remains the same, I will update this page every day with my progress!

## Part I : 08/06 - 17/06 :dart:
* Finishing my Blog/Portfolio
* Complete Docker and Kubernetes trainings:
    * https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-docker-2
    * https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-kubernetes 
* Solving one medium puzzle on CodinGame https://www.codingame.com/
* Solving one code Kata http://codekata.com/
* Start reading the pragmatic programmer: Finishing chapter 1: A Pragmatic Philosophy https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/ 
* Solve one LeetCode per day!

### Day 0: June 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Started Docker course on LI, install it and started playing a bit with it! Chapter 2 so far! https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-docker-2/the-docker-flow-containers-to-images?u=75507506
* LeetCode of the day: https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings/submissions/

**Thoughts:** 
It's probably better to do it early in the morning as I was a bit tired after work!
I displayed both hints to solve the leetcode, I should take more time before using them!
